# Groovy Goodness

Eway Groovy Goodness series is a subset which categorizes and filter best practices of Groovy Goodness series [a series of blog entries](http://mrhaki.blogspot.com) on Groovy features. And what better way to show a feature than with a code sample. In this repository, the samples for the different blog entries are stored.

The directory `Blog/Posts` contains directories for each blog entry. The sample Groovy files are placed inside those directories.

The directory `OfflineSite` contains the articles from the blog as local HTML files. If we open the file `index.hmtl` we can start browsing through the blog posts.

# Author and Origin
The samples are written by [mrhaki](http://www.mrhaki.com) who's real name is Hubert Klein Ikkink.
