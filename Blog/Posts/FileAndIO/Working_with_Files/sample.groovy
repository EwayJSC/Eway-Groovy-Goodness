// Writing to the files with the write method:
file1.write 'Working with files the Groovy way is easy.\n'

// Using the leftShift operator:
file1 << 'See how easy it is to add text to a file.\n'

// Using the text property:
file2.text = '''We can even use the text property of
a file to set a complete block of text at once.'''

// Or a writer object:
file3.withWriter('UTF-8') { writer ->
    writer.write('We can also use writers to add contents.')

// Reading contents of files to an array:
def lines = file1.readLines()
assert 2 == lines.size()

assert 'We can also use writers to add contents.' == file3.text

                break
        }
        count++
    }
}

// We can also read contents with a filter:
sw = new StringWriter()
file1.filterLine(sw) { it =~ /Groovy/ }
assert 'Working with files the Groovy way is easy.\r\n' == sw.toString()

// We can look for files in the directory with different methods.
// See for a complete list the File GDK documentation.
