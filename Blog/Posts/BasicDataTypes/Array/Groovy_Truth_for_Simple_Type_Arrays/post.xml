If the array is empty we get false, otherwise true is returned. Support for byte, short, int, long, float, double, char and boolean type arrays is added to Groovy. This functionality already worked for Object arrays, but now also for simple type arrays.</p>
<pre class="brush:groovy">
def bytes = [] as byte[]
def ints = [1,2,4] as int[]
def floats = [] as float[]
def booleans = [true, false] as boolean[]

assert !bytes
assert ints
assert !floats
assert booleans
