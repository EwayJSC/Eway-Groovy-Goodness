We pass a closure to this method, which is executed when our Groovy script or application stops. This can be a normal termination, but the closure is also executed when the application is stopped by user input (<code>Ctrl+C</code>) or a system event like a shutdown.</p>
<pre class="brush:groovy">
addShutdownHook {
    println ''  
    println 'Script is ended.'
}

println 'Script is started.'
println 'Press Ctrl+C to stop this script or wait 10 seconds.'
(1..10).each {
    print "..$it"
    Thread.sleep 1000
}
